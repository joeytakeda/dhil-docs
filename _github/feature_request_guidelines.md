# Feature Request Guidelines

This document explains the process for requesting a feature in GitHub.

## What's a Feature?

A feature is a specific functionality that you would like your projec t to have. A Feature Request is how you ask for a completely new feature (fixes to existing functionality should be filed as a [Bug](bug_guidelines.md). Features are usually described in the project proposal, but may also arise organically as the project progresses. Our feature request template contains several questions that will help us understand your request and get it right. Please try to be as specific as possible.

## Accessing Feature Requests

Here are the steps to access the bug report template in your **GitHub Repository**. 

1. Ensure that you are in your repository on GitHub by looking for the acronym for your project in the top left-hand corner. In the example below, we know we're in the repository for the Social and Economic Networks Project (SEN) since the link in the corner says `sfu-dhil/sen`. You can also confirm you're in your repository by looking at the About block on the right hand side. <br><br> If you're unsure about how to locate your repository, you can email [dhil-projects@sfu.ca](mailto:dhil-projects@sfu.ca) and we can provide you with the link.
1.  Click on **Issues**:<br><br>

A concise statement about the importance of the feature and the impact it should have on your project.
